## My Emacs config
This is my emacs configuration. I use it for:
- Editing configuration files
- Reading books
- Checking my Emails and News
- Programming in C, Java and scripting in bash
- Git
- File Explorer

## My Goal
.. is to use as few additional packages as possible and If I have to use Windows, it should also work there oob. It should Install without any user intervention. I also customized my statusbar to look vanilla but more clean.
